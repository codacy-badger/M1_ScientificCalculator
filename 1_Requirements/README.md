## Introduction
   - A Scientific Calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics. They have completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings. 

## Research
   - Calculators provide advantages for students when performing calculations
and they can provide teachers with a versatile instructional tool. Students face highstakes mathematics tests each year in middle school and must take Regents and college entrance exams during their high school career. It is important to properly integrate calculator use so that students can derive the full benefit of familiarity with the instrument while maintaining a high level of student proficiency with paper and pencil calculations.
   - Todayâ€™s scientific calculators are highly powerful and  if  their operation is properly understood, a little innovative imagination can  do wonders. Long calculations are  a  normal part of design and analysis, where students spend time like anything, and conclude the computational procedure in distaste.
   - **Calculator Techniques**
       - Almost  all  scientific  calculators  posses  a  temporary  register  under  the  key  Ans,  which automatically modifies after each computation, and holds the current result. In design or analysis, this  result  is  usually  needed  by  the  next  step.  Still  there  are  examples  where  recursive computations are necessary to ascertain the final results. Normally, calculators have a few more variable  like  A,  B,  C,  ...  but  presently  a  description  is  restricted  on  some  simple  tricks  based upon the Ans key only. In below figure the general scheme adopted here is presented.

   - **Timeline**
        - ***Past***
             - The Hewlett-Packard 9100A is an early programmable calculator, first appearing in 1968. HP called it a desktop calculator because, as Bill Hewlett said, "If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an IBM.

             - The HP-35, introduced on February 1, 1972, was Hewlett-Packard's first pocket calculator and the world's first handheld scientific calculator. Like some of HP's desktop calculators it used RPN. Introduced at US$395, the HP-35 was available from 1972 to 1975.

        - ***Future***
             - We can make Calculator much more robust by adding avanced features that are usefull for science, engineering, and mathematics.

           
## Defining Our System
   - This is Scientific Calculator build using **C language**.
   - It contains normal mathematical functions, exponents, log, natural log (ln), trig functions ,power,modulo,squreroot,cuberoot etc.
   - The main moto of this apllication is to be comfurtable with C language,pointers,functions and main thing is to be familiar with Unit testing.
   - ***Unit testing*** is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the developers.

   - In this apllication I used ***Makefile*** which is special file, containing shell commands, that you create and name makefile.While in the directory containing this makefile, you will type make and the commands in the makefile will be executed.

   - In this apllication we are using ***Doxygen*** which is a documentation generator and static analysis tool for software source trees. When used as a documentation generator, Doxygen extracts information from specially-formatted comments within the code.
